After installation of the mod, the game will generate presets on first boot.
The game will parse the game rooms for tile and preset data. 
Preset data is generated on a room by room basis (the local scope) and for all rooms (the global scope).
By default the "local and global" scope is used. This means you can use and interact with both tile data sets.
This is required for functionality and will only occur once. 
Weird visuals/audio may happen during this period. This is normal. 
When it is complete, the game will restart and the tile editor will be available for use.

How it works:
Presets are saved to the "presets" folder in your save directory.
Invalid tiles (based on having an invalid background property) will not be saved as a preset. 

The following information is saved, in this order:

Background: The background of the given preset.
Tile Preset Left: The X value of the top left corner of the preset tile (relative to the background from which it is from).
Tile Preset Top: The Y value of the top left corner of the preset tile (relative to the background from which it is from).
Tile Preset Width: The preset tile's width.
Tile Preset Height: The preset tile's height.
Tile Preset X SCALE: The X scale of the preset tile.
Tile Preset Y SCALE: The Y scale of the preset tile.
