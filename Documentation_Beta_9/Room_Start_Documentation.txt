If the new tile data exists for the room you are entering then it is loaded.
Otherwise the default tile data is saved and loaded.
If it is not generating the presets at first boot, the presets will be loaded.
Otherwise, if it is, then all objects will be deactivated.
If it is Undertale, "obj_screen" will then be re-activated to avoid crashes.
