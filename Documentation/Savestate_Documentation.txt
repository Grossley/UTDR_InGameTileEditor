There are 11 savestate slots available, 0-10. Use "Q" to iterate through them. Press "S" to save the savestate. Changes to the data.win file will likely result in the savestate data becoming invalid. If you try to load invalid savestate the game will crash. If a savestate is invalid, please overwrite or delete it. Press "0" to delete the current savestate (if it exists). Press "L" to load the savestate, if it exists. If the game has been modified there is a high chance that attempting this will result in a game crash.
