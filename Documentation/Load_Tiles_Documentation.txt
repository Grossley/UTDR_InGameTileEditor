If the new tile data for the game exists, then it will be loaded. Otherwise, the original tile data will be loaded. 
If neither exist, an error will occur, forcing the game to stop.
The following data is loaded, in this order, for each tile:
Tile ID:
Tile background:
Tile left:
Tile top:
Tile width:
Tile height:
Tile X:
Tile Y:
Tile Depth:
Tile X Scale:
Tile Y Scale:
Tile Alpha:
Tile Color (Blend):
Tile Visibility: 
If no tile by the current tile ID exists, a new one is added.
Then the background, visibility, alpha, blend (color), depth, region, scale, and position is set.

Once loaded, the new tiles are checked against the original tiles. If a tile is missing from the new set that is present in the original set, a mismatch is indicated. The tile is then deleted from the room.
