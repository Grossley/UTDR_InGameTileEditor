Press "F" to enable freecam.

After the freecam is enabled, these are available to use:
Press "I" to zoom in closer to the room.
Press "O" to zoom out further from the room.
Use the arrow keys to pan the camera across the map.
Press left click to place obj_mainchara at any location on the map.

There is a small but possible chance of the game crashing due to dependent objects not being able to access obj_mainchara. Please report if such a bug occurs right away to Grossley#2869 on Discord.
